    üéÉ A spooky Discord bot
  </p>
</blockquote>

This project is convenient for people who want to get into open source and contribute to different projects especially during the Hacktoberfest.

*Don't hesitate to ask me for help on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nEDcagb), I would help you with great pleasure!*

# What does he do?
For the moment, the bot reacts with emojis according to the words present in the messages.
For example, if you send the following message: "I saw a ghost today", SpookyBot will add the reaction `üëª` to the message.
