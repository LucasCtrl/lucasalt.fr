Some simple words know by everyone in the IT sector to check if the program is running at the first start. In my case, to welcome you for the first time...

<!-- end -->

I created this website because I just would like to have a place to express myself and share all my researches. Feel free to take a look each day, week, month, ... It's all up to you.

What kind of thing you will find on this blog? I don't really know. Some "hacks" about a framework, some previews about my electronic projects, ...

**Anyway, welcome and happy reading!**
