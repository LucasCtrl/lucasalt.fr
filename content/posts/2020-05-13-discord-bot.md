The 14th May 2020, Discord celebrated his 5th anniversary. In this occasion, I'd like to update a old tutorial which explain you how to create a Discord bot.

The bot will be written in Javascript and will running with Node.js.

# Tools

Before we write some code, we need to install some tools. The first one is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Node.js is a tool that allow you to execute Javascript code server-side. When you install Node.js, the wizard also install [npm](https://npmjs.com). This tool allow you to install some modules. A module is a portion of code that someone write for you. For example, [express](https://expressjs.com) is a framework for creating some web apps. In our case, we are going to use [discord.js](https://discord.js.org). **Discord.js** is a node module which allow you to access to the Discord API easily.
