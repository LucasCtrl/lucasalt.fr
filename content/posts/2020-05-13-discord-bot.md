The 14th May 2020, Discord celebrated his 5th anniversary. In this occasion, I'd like to update a old tutorial which explain you how to create a Discord bot.

The bot will be written in Javascript and Node.js we also going to use [discord.js](https://discord.js.org). **Discord.js** is a node module which allow you to access to the Discord API easily.
