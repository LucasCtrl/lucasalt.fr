Some simple words know by everyone in the IT sector. This website is here because I just would like to have a place to express myself and share all my researches. Feel free to take a look each day, week, month, ... It's all up to you.

What kind of thing you will find on this blog? I don't really know. Some "hacks" about a framework, some previews about my electronic projects, ...

Anyway, welcome and happy reading!
