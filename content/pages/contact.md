Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas Albert, a 21 years old web developer who got a Bachelor degree in the wood work area based in Strasbourg, France.

> **Optimization** and **minimalism** are my creed.

When I was a kid, DIY was my favorite hobby and office work didn't interest me much. So I made the choice to do a professional baccalaureate in carpentry. Since then, I have continued my studies in the field to obtain a professional bachelor's degree. Now I'm intended to be a design office technician in order to improve the productivity of the work stations.

In parallel, I am a web developer. I've been always surrounded by this environment thanks to my dad so for me it's almost innate. So, I work on several projects, mainly open-source, with Node.js and Python.
